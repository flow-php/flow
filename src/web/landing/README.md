# Flow PHP - Web

## Prerequisite
To run web page locally, you need to have Symfony CLI installed locally.
Instruction on how to install it can be found here: [https://symfony.com/download](https://symfony.com/download).

## Setup
First create a local certificate authority for the server:
```shell
symfony server:ca:install
```

Run symfony web server:
```shell
symfony server:start --dir=public -d
```

To stop symfony web server, execute:
```shell
symfony local:server:stop --dir=public
```

Page will be accessible from [https://127.0.0.1:8000/app_dev.php](https://127.0.0.1:8000/app_dev.php) url.

## Working with CSS using Tailwind
We strive to eliminate usage of Node and NPM in Flow PHP, so we decided to use standalone CLI executable here.
You can find download instructions on [an official page here](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).
Below you can find instruction for setting up Tailwind for macos x86_64 architecture (you can find out architecture in unix systems using `uname -m ` command):

Download file:
```shell
curl -Lo bin/tailwindcss https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-macos-x64
```

Modify permissions to make this file an executable:
```shell
chmod +x bin/tailwindcss
```

Additional one-time step on macos systems to verify downloaded executable:
```shell
open bin/tailwindcss
```

CSS generated by Tailwind is already committed in the repository. To regenerate it, execute:
```shell
composer tailwindcss:build
```

or if you want to keep it running in the watch mode, execute:
```shell
composer tailwindcss:watch
```
