     * The sort orders for logical types are:

     *   INT8 - signed comparison
     *   INT16 - signed comparison
     *   INT32 - signed comparison
     *   INT64 - signed comparison
     *   UINT8 - unsigned comparison
     *   UINT16 - unsigned comparison
     *   UINT32 - unsigned comparison
     *   UINT64 - unsigned comparison
     *   DECIMAL - signed comparison of the represented value
     *   DATE - signed comparison
     *   TIME_MILLIS - signed comparison
     *   TIME_MICROS - signed comparison
     *   TIMESTAMP_MILLIS - signed comparison
     *   TIMESTAMP_MICROS - signed comparison
     *   INTERVAL - unsigned comparison
     *   JSON - unsigned byte-wise comparison
     *   BSON - unsigned byte-wise comparison
     *   ENUM - unsigned byte-wise comparison
     *   LIST - undefined
     *   MAP - undefined.
     *
     * In the absence of logical types, the sort order is determined by the physical type:
     *   BOOLEAN - false, true
     *   INT32 - signed comparison
     *   INT64 - signed comparison
     *   INT96 (only used for legacy timestamps) - undefined
     *   FLOAT - signed comparison of the represented value (*)
     *   DOUBLE - signed comparison of the represented value (*)
     *   BYTE_ARRAY - unsigned byte-wise comparison
     *   FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY - unsigned byte-wise comparison
     *
     * (*) Because the sorting order is not specified properly for floating
     *     point values (relations vs. total ordering) the following
     *     compatibility rules should be applied when reading statistics:
     *     - If the min is a NaN, it should be ignored.
     *     - If the max is a NaN, it should be ignored.
     *     - If the min is +0, the row group may contain -0 values as well.
     *     - If the max is -0, the row group may contain +0 values as well.
     *     - When looking for NaN values, min and max should be ignored.
     *
     *     When writing statistics the following rules should be followed:
     *     - NaNs should not be written to min or max statistics fields.
     *     - If the computed max value is zero (whether negative or positive),
     *       `+0.0` should be written into the max statistics field.
     *     - If the computed min value is zero (whether negative or positive),
     *       `-0.0` should be written into the min statistics field.
