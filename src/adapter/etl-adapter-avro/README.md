# ETL Adapter: Avro

Avro integration was temporarily abandoned due to the lack of availability of good libraries for PHP.
If you are interested in this integration, please let us know by creating an issue in the repository.

At some point in the future, we are going to write our own Avro library for PHP, but it is not a priority at the moment.
