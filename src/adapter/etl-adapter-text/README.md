## Description

ETL Adapter that provides Loaders and Extractors that works with Text files.
It does not require any external dependencies, it's working on internal PHP functions.

## Installation

```
composer require flow-php/etl-adapter-text:1.x@dev
```

## Extractor 

```php
<?php

use Flow\ETL\DSL\Text;
use Flow\ETL\Flow;

$rows = (new Flow())
    ->read(Text::from(new LocalFile($path)))

```

## Loader 

> :warning: Heads up, TextLoader expects rows to have single entry in order to properly write them into file.

```php 
<?php

use Flow\ETL\DSL\Text;
use Flow\ETL\Row;
use Flow\ETL\Rows;

(new Flow())
    ->process(
        new Rows(
            Row::create(new Row\Entry\StringEntry('name', 'Norbert')),
            Row::create(new Row\Entry\StringEntry('name', 'Tomek')),
            Row::create(new Row\Entry\StringEntry('name', 'Dawid')),
