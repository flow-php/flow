Schema inferring is a process of generating a schema from a whole or part of the dataset.   
Once schema is inferred, it can be saved and used to speed up next dataset processing.

All Extractors will try to auto-detect schema however, providing schema explicitly is always a good practice 
since it can significantly speed up an extraction process by avoiding expensive schema detection.
