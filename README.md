## Installation 

This package is a [monorepo](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/).
Please check the below packages and select only those that you are going to use, 
this will reduce the number of unnecessary dependencies in your project (less maintenance).

For example, if you want to work with JSON/CSV files here are the dependencies you will need to install: 

```shell
composer require flow-php/etl:^0.1 flow-php/etl-adapter-csv:^0.1 flow-php/etl-adapter-json:^0.1
```

## Usage

In order to understand how Flow works, please read [documentation](src/core/etl/README.md)

### [Usage Examples](examples/README.md)

## Building blocks

* DataFrame - Lazy data processing frame.
* Rows - Immutable collection of `Row` objects.
* Row - Immutable, strongly typed collection of `Entry` objects.
* Entry - Immutable, strongly typed object representing a cell in a row.
* **E**xtractor (Reader) - Memory safe, Data Source returning \Generator, yielding `Rows` to the `Pipeline`
* **T**ransformer - Data transformer receiving and returning `Rows` (in most cases transformer), one instance of `Rows` at once.
* **L**oader (Writer) - Memory safe representation of Data Sink, the responsibility of Loader is to write `Rows` into destination storage, one at time.
* Pipeline - Interface representing ETL process, each received `Rows` instanced is passed through all `Pipes`, also responsible for error handling.
* Pipe - Loader of Transformer instance existing in the `Pipes` collection.

## Asynchronous Processing
