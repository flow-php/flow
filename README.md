## Contributing 

In order to run tests locally please make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) up and running.
You also need [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to be available from your CLI.

For the code coverage, please install [pcov](https://pecl.php.net/package/pcov).

### Prepare Project:

```
cp docker-compose.yml.dist docker-compose.yml
composer install 
docker compose up -d
```

### Run Test Suite 

```
composer test
```

### Run Static Analyze 

```
composer static:analyze
```

### Test everything

This command will execute exactly the same tests as we run at Github Actions before PR can get merged.
If it passes locally, you are good to open pull request. 

```
composer build 
```

## Usage

In order to understand how Flow works, please read [documentation](src/core/etl/README.md)

### [Usage Examples](examples/README.md)

## Features

* low and constant memory consumption
* asynchronous data processing
* reading from any data source
* writing to any data source
* rich collection of data transformation functions
* direct access to remote filesystems
* partitioning 
* grouping & aggregating
* remote files processing
* joins
* sorting
* displaying datasets as ASCII table
* validation against schema
* caching

## Asynchronous Processing

* [etl-adapter-amphp](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-amphp)
* [etl-adapter-reactphp](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-reactphp)

## Building blocks

* DataFrame - Lazy data processing frame.
* Rows - Immutable colllection of `Row` objects.
* Row - Immutable, strongly typed collection of `Entry` objects.
* Entry - Immutable, strongly typed object representing cell in a row.
* **E**xtractor (Reader) - Memory safe, Data Source returning \Generator, yielding `Rows` to the `Pipeline`
* **T**ransformer - Data transformer receiving and returning `Rows` (in most cases transformer), one instance of `Rows` at once.
* **L**oader (Writer) - Memory safe representation of Data Sink, responsibility of Loader is to write `Rows` into destination storage, one at time.
* Pipeline - Interface representing ETL process, each received `Rows` instanced is pased through all `Pipes`, also responsible for error handling.
* Pipe - Loader of Transformer instance existing in `Pipes` collection.

### Supported PHP versions

* 8.1 - âœ…
