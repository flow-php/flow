## Flow PHP

Flow is the most advanced PHP ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework. 

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use function Flow\ETL\Adapter\Parquet\{from_parquet, to_parquet};
use function Flow\ETL\DSL\{data_frame, lit, ref, sum, to_output, overwrite};
use Flow\ETL\Filesystem\SaveMode;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

data_frame()
    ->read(from_parquet(__DIR__ . '/orders_flow.parquet'))
    ->select('created_at', 'total_price', 'discount')
    ->withEntry('created_at', ref('created_at')->cast('date')->dateFormat('Y/m'))
    ->withEntry('revenue', ref('total_price')->minus(ref('discount')))
    ->select('created_at', 'revenue')
    ->groupBy('created_at')
    ->aggregate(sum(ref('revenue')))
    ->sortBy(ref('created_at')->desc())
    ->withEntry('daily_revenue', ref('revenue_sum')->round(lit(2))->numberFormat(lit(2)))
    ->drop('revenue_sum')
    ->write(to_output(truncate: false))
    ->withEntry('created_at', ref('created_at')->toDate('Y/m'))
    ->saveMode(overwrite())
    ->write(to_parquet(__DIR__ . '/daily_revenue.parquet'))
    ->run();
```

```console
$ php daily_revenue.php
