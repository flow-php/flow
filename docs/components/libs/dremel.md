```
composer require flow-php/dremel
```

Dremel is a php implementation of the [Google Dremel](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/pl//pubs/archive/36632.pdf) paper. 
The goal of this library is to flatten and later hydrate nested data structures into a columnar format, which is more efficient for querying.

This library was developed to provide a nested structures support for PHP Parquet implementation.
