# Key Features

- **Low memory footprint**: Optimized for efficiency, Flow PHP ensures minimal memory usage, maintaining low and constant consumption regardless of data size. This makes it ideal for handling large datasets without compromising performance.
- **Versatile Data Source Interaction**: Whether your data resides in databases, spreadsheets, or online platforms, Flow PHP can seamlessly read from and write to any data source.
- **Rich Collection of Data Transformation Functions**: Transform your data with ease using a wide array of built-in functions. From simple mapping to complex manipulations, the framework covers all your data transformation needs.
- **Direct Access to Remote Filesystems**: Flow PHP provides the ability to interact directly with remote filesystems, facilitating efficient data handling and processing without the need for local storage.
- **Advanced Data Partitioning**: Efficiently partition your data for improved manageability and processing. This feature is crucial for handling large datasets or for processing data in distributed systems.
- **Grouping & Aggregating**: Easily group and aggregate data to extract meaningful insights. This feature is particularly useful for summarizing datasets and performing statistical analysis.
- **Remote File Processing**: Process files stored remotely with the same ease as local files, enabling powerful and flexible data integration from various sources.
- **Join Operations**: Perform join operations between different datasets. This is essential for combining data from multiple sources, providing a more comprehensive view.
- **Efficient Sorting**: Sort your data based on specific criteria or conditions, ensuring that your datasets are organized precisely as needed.
- **ASCII Table Display**: Visualize your datasets as neatly formatted ASCII tables, making it easier to read and analyze data directly from the console.
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure data quality and consistency by validating your datasets against predefined schemas.
- **Window Functions**: Utilize window functions for advanced data analysis, allowing you to perform calculations across sets of rows that are related to the current row.
- **Built-In Caching Mechanism**: Improve performance with built-in caching, reducing processing time and enhancing overall efficiency, especially in repetitive data processing tasks.
